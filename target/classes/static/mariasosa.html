   <font size="5"><center><p> A senior living in California with her two parents. Defines being American as “someone who has unlimited opportunities.” Maria has citizenship, but her parents are undocumented, but still, she considers herself and her family Americans. She is grateful and humble. She knows how valuable her life here in the U.S is. She knows she wouldn’t have the same opportunities in Latin America. Though she is advised by her parents to not show her roots in public too much or in English speaking settings. Because of this she feels as if she is being asked to give up her culture and a language that is familiar to her, so that she can adapt to her surroundings. She knows it’s unfair that she has to do that when in a “white space”. She has noticed that when closed minded people are exposed to another culture or something they’re unfamiliar with, they try to stop others from doing what they’re lawfully free to do. </p></center></font></div class="container">
